    <p>
      This is the only crispy fried chicken recipe you'll ever need. Why? It
      combines all the tried-and-true tricks to ensure the juiciest, most
      flavorful, crispiest chicken every time.
    </p>

    <h1>What Makes This Fried Chicken So Crispy?</h1>
    <p>There are a few reasons this crispy fried chicken works so well:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Allowing the buttermilk-flour mixture to come to a paste-like
        consistency is key to a crispiness on the outside and juiciness on the
        inside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Most fried chicken is cooked at a high temperature throughout the frying
        process. This one, however, only starts at a very high heat â€” after
        browning, the heat is reduced for about 30 minutes. <br />
        You'll turn up the temperature again at the end, locking in that crispy
        texture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Paprika adds smoky flavor and has a low smoke point, which helps with
        browning the chicken.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (4 pound) chicken, cut into pieces</li>
      <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour for coating</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">
        Take your cut up chicken pieces and skin them if you prefer.
      </li>

      <li>
        Put the flour in a large plastic bag (let the amount of chicken you are
        cooking dictate the amount of flour you use). <br />
        Season the flour with paprika, salt and pepper to taste (paprika helps
        to brown the chicken).
      </li>

      />

      <li>
        Dip chicken pieces in buttermilk then, a few at a time, put them in the
        bag with the flour, seal the bag and shake to coat well.
      </li>

      <li>
        Place the coated chicken on a cookie sheet or tray, and cover with a
        clean dish towel or waxed paper. <br />
        LET SIT UNTIL THE FLOUR IS OF A PASTE-LIKE CONSISTENCY. THIS IS CRUCIAL!

      <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">
        Fill a large skillet (cast iron is best) about 1/3 to 1/2 full with
        vegetable oil. Heat until VERY hot.
      </li>

      <li>
        Put in as many chicken pieces as the skillet can hold. Brown the chicken
        in HOT oil on both sides.
      </li>

      />

      <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">
        When browned, reduce heat and cover skillet; let cook for 30 minutes
        (the chicken will be cooked through but not crispy). <br />
        Remove cover, raise heat again, and continue to fry until crispy.
      </li>

      <li>
        Drain the fried chicken on paper towels. Depending on how much chicken
        you have, you may have to fry in a few shifts. <br />
        Keep the finished chicken in a slightly warm oven while preparing the
        rest.
      </li>
